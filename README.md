Figure 3 generated using "age_v_young_batch.R" using uninjured aged and young datasets as well as Tabula Muris Senis limb muscle datasets.

Figure 4 generated with "scAging_scVelo.R" followed by "scVelo.ipynb" using aged injury timecourse datasets (0, 3, and 7dpi).

Figure 5 generated with "sod1ko_v_rescue.R" using aged and young uninjured datasets, Tabula Muris Senis limb muscle datasets, and SOD1-/- and SynTgSod1-/- datasets. 

Raw and processed datasets available on GEO.
